# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project builds an end-to-end customer churn prediction system using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. The goal is to identify customers at high risk of leaving the service and provide actionable insights for retention strategies.

## Steps Covered
- Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis
- Customer segmentation using K-Means clustering
- Churn prediction using Logistic Regression and Random Forest
- Model evaluation using ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1-score
- Feature importance analysis and business recommendations
- Churn risk scoring for real-world decision making

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression (final model)
- Random Forest (comparison)

## Key Results
- Logistic Regression achieved ROC-AUC of 0.84
- Identified key churn drivers: contract type, tenure, monthly charges
- Provided actionable business recommendations for churn reduction

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab

## Dataset
Telco Customer Churn Dataset
